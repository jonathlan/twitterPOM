One two three!
My baby don't mess around
'Cause she loves me so
This I know fo sho!
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out tha door
Don't try to fight the feeling
Because the thought alone is killin' me right now
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking to together
Like we don't know how
